= QUAD Format Specification v0.5
by Rufas Wan
:toc:



== Introduction

QUAD file is mainly for 2D sprites on modern 3D graphics engine. Every drawing is a polygon in square, rectangle, or other quadrilaterals (hence the name QUAD).

The major difference from 2D sprite:

* Instead creating a new drawing for every possible transformation, the sprites can be transform directly using GPU.
* Two transformation can be interpolate during animation. This creates a new type of sprites with 2D doll-like movement.
* If the 2D sprite is properly layered, its depth value can be faked, allowing dynamic lighting and shadow calculations later.
* All indexed color textures will be convert to RGBA true color textures when loading. There are no more palette animations.
* The texture can be in grayscale to be blended with user selected colors. This can be better than editing palettes that edits only 1 color at a time (and that color can be affecting multiple unrelated layers). Blending the whole layer is a lot more convenient, but cost CPU/GPU processing power.
* As everything on GPU is measured in `-1.0 to +1.0` or `0.0 to 1.0`, rounding error is a very common problem.
* Anti-Alias and Smoothing filters are often used to blend the sharp outer edge of 3D models and background. It may not be suitable for 2D pixel art.

The major difference from 3D model:

* It is still animated in frames, instead of using delta time. On a normal 60 FPS (frames per seconds) game, 1 frame is 16.67 milliseconds.
* X and Y is the same as 2D image. +X is right direction, +Y is down direction, and they are measured in px (pixels).
* On drawing, `[0,0]` is still at the center of the canvas. If the canvas size is 320x240, then X is `-160px to +160px`, and Y is `-120px to +120px`.
* Z or depth value are not used. It is faked on drawing for perspective correction and drawing order.
* As every polygons are quadrilateral with 4 unique x,y coordinates, indices are not needed. They are auto-generated when drawing as 2 triangles.
* No triangulation needed. The 2 triangles never need to be further broken into smaller triangles.
* Camera Clipping Planes are not used. There are no `near` and `far` in 2D games. Everything within the camera are drawn. Camera is only used for zoom in or out for dramatic effects.
* Full opaque/solid sprites doesn't exists in 2D. There are always transparent/semi-transparent pixels surrounding the sprite, including GUI elements and textbox.
* 3D technique of reducing GPU overdraw by rendering opaque objects front-to-back order is not applicable. All sprites, regardless of opaque/transparent, is rendered in back-to-front order (Painter's algorithm).



== Basic File Structure

image::spec-rel.png[spec-rel.png]

A QUAD file consists of multiple sub objects:

* #`keyframe`# defines the drawings of a frame.
* #`hitbox`# defines the areas for collusion detection for a frame.
* #`animation`# defines the changes between frames over time.
* #`skeleton`# defines the relationship between frames.
