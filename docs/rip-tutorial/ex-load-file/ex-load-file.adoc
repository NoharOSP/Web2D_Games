=== Loading Files
ifndef::rel[:rel: .]

Game::
	PSP Princess Crown
Debugger::
	PPSSPP <<ppsspp>>

To be able to start from input data, you'll need to know which files is actually loaded for the scene.

Let's start by looking for a file list on RAM using a file name from the game

TIP: File names can be case insensitive matched. So try all uppercase, all lowercase, and/or mixed case.

TIP: You can start with file extension.


image:{rel}/load-file-1.png[link={rel}/load-file-1.png,height=240]
image:{rel}/load-file-2.png[link={rel}/load-file-2.png,height=240]

We found the the file at RAM 8aeb410. By observing the pattern, the file entry is an array `["FILE.NAME", int32 LBA, int32 file size]` and has fixed 0x1c bytes size.

Looking for where the list begins and ends, we discovered the area for the whole list is `from RAM 8ae6ae4 to RAM 8af51e4` (size = 0xe700).


image::{rel}/load-break-1.png[link={rel}/load-break-1.png,height=240]

As usual, when we have something we want to inspect, we'll put a READ breakpoint on the whole thing.


image:{rel}/load-break-2.png[link={rel}/load-break-2.png,height=240]
image:{rel}/load-break-3.png[link={rel}/load-break-3.png,height=240]

As the game search by file name, the ASM code is about comparing every character for a match. Even PPSSPP able to recognize this function as `strcmp()` (string compare).

We are no interest for `strcmp()` itself, but the parent function that called it. We will use "Step Into" until the function returned. We end up at ASM address `89e38e4`.


image:{rel}/load-ghidra-1.png[link={rel}/load-ghidra-1.png,height=240]
image:{rel}/load-ghidra-2.png[link={rel}/load-ghidra-2.png,height=240]

With that, we can use Ghidra <<ghidra>> to decompile the function.

`SUB_001ecdbc` is `strcmp()`, so basically the function is about looping a list of 3000 file entries and return the file entry when it matched.

NOTE: You can skip this step with Ghidra if you can understand the ASM code directly. This is a very simple function to begin with.

Since READ breakpoint will always break at `strcmp()` on every file entries, with a list of 3000 entries, it is no longer usefule for us.

This is where we'll disable the READ breakpoint. and use EXECUTE breakpoint instead.


image::{rel}/load-opcode.png[link={rel}/load-opcode.png,height=240]

We will put EXECUTE breakpoint when the file entry matched and ready for return, at this 2 ASM address:

....
89e3904  lw  s2, 18(v0)
89e39a0  lw  s2, 18(v0)
....

NOTE: EXECUTE breakpoint is for discover inner workings of the function, which is something only possible after the ASM code is discovered by using READ or WRITE breakpoint.

By keeping track of value at `v0`, we will get a list of file names the game trying to load. For example, when Gradriel went into Valenadine City Pub, the game will look for these files (in order):

|===
|v0 |filename

|8af1d2c |TORUNEKO.VOL
|8aed0d4 |GODY.VOL
|8aea00c |BABA.VOL
|8aed294 |GORO.VOL
|8af4b1c |WINE.VOL
|8af4dbc |WN1C.VOL
|8ae7388 |002_01_4.EVN
|===

When the file loading order is known, we also reduced the number of files we are working with from 2000+ files to just 7 files.

This technique is also useful on these situations

. When the game files are a bunch of meaningless numbers, like `000_00_0.EVN`.
. When the game files are in sets, it can be in 2's (texture + atlas) or in 3's (texture + atlas + palette)
. When the game files are shared and has very weird or unknown combinations.
