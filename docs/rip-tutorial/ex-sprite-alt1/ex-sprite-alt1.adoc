=== Sprite Data (no Cheat Engine)
ifndef::rel[:rel: .]


It is an alternative method to explore RAM when Cheat Engine is not available, didn't work or could not be used.

A save state will make a backup for the whole program. It will have a copy of RAM dump in it. So the first step is to find a way to extract the RAM dump from save state.

Luckily, nocash PSX has the option to make uncompressed save state:


image::{rel}/save-aya-1.png[link={rel}/save-aya-1.png,height=240]

Just like Cheat Engine before, we need to find the base RAM address. Goto RAM 80010000, edit in byte sequence "41 79 61" (Aya) and then make a save state.

Since the save state is not compressed, we can simply use a hex editor and look for "Aya" (as string or byte sequence).


image:{rel}/save-aya-2.png[link={rel}/save-aya-2.png,height=240]
image:{rel}/save-aya-3.png[link={rel}/save-aya-3.png,height=240]

We found "Aya" at `99064`. Convert it back to PSX RAM address from `80000000` to `80200000`:

....
PSX 80000000 = FILE 99064 - 10000
	= FILE 89064

PSX 80200000 = FILE 89064 + 200000
	= FILE 289064
....

With that, we can start exploring RAM dump for sprite data. Refer to <<raw_image>> for more details.


image:{rel}/save-sprite-1.png[link={rel}/save-sprite-1.png,height=240]
image:{rel}/save-sprite-2.png[link={rel}/save-sprite-2.png,height=240]

We discover the graphic data on save state offset `22efe0`. Using the base address, we can translate it back to PSX RAM at:

....
FILE 22efe0 = 22efe0 - 89064 + PSX 80000000
	= PSX 801a5f7c
....

TIP: It never hurt to go back to nocash PSX to double-check if both address has the same data.

And then we can put WRITE breakpoint to look for the decompression function. Everything is the same after that.


Other Emulators::
* PCSX2 save state is a normal ZIP file. Just rename the extension `from .p2s to .zip`, the `eeMemory.bin` file is the RAM dump.
