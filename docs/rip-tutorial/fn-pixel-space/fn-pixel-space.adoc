=== Pixel Space

The drawing XY are in space-like coordinates, similar to 3D space. The XY can be from -infinite to +infinite px. So all sprite are aligned with `[0,0]`.

Basically, like 3D models, `[0,0]` makes the sprite coordinate self-contained. The game can then "transform" the sprite to its in-game entity position.

Some people refer `[0,0]` as "origin" or "root". I call it "center point". And here is an article referring it as "hot spots" <<mckids>>.

Here is the process how I convert XY from pixel space to canvas position:

From the image above, the drawing XY for sprite is `[-130,-160 , -130,10 , 150,10 , 150,-160]`

First, we'll need to prepare a canvas large enough to hold the full sprite. We will use the absolute value <<absval>> of the drawing XY to calculate the size.

NOTE: The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero. It is thus always either a positive number or zero, but never negative.

The absolute values for X are `[130,130,150,150]`. So the canvas width is:

....
max value * 2 = 150 px * 2 = 300 px
....

The absolute values for Y are `[160,10,160,10]`. So the canvas height is:

....
max value * 2 = 160 px * 2 = 320 px
....

With that we will prepare a 300x320 px canvas, with `[150,160]` represent `[0,0]` in pixel space. The sprite will be drawn at

....
[-130+150 , -160+160] = [ 20 ,   0]
[-130+150 ,   10+160] = [ 20 , 170]
[ 150+150 ,   10+160] = [300 , 170]
[ 150+150 , -160+160] = [300 ,   0]
....

The result drawing position on the canvas is `[20,0 , 20,170 , 300,170 , 300,0]`.

It is also very simple to revert canvas position back to pixel space - just subtract `[150,160]`.

Since everything is aligned to `[0,0]` in pixel space, it doesn't matter what the final canvas size is, they will all align together correctly for animations.
