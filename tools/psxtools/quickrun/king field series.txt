	The bug is that some areas won't load properly, as shown in this youtube video:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQuTx-7PlwA

	For PCSX2 users, the game plays best with EE/FPU Round Mode set to the default "Chop/Zero"
	(or "Nearest", which seems to behave similarly).
	But this bug will almost certainly bite you in those modes
	-- the only workaround I could find mentioned on the internet was to set EE/FPU Round Mode to "Negative"
	before going near the staircase,
	and switch it back when you reach the top of the stairs.
