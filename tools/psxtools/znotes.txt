	The Mega Drive games use angles in hex,
	$00 through $FF,
	meaning that there are only 256 divisions of a circle,
	not 360 like we're used to.
	Worse, the direction is anti-clockwise compared to other languages like GML,
	so $20 isn't 45 degree like it should be - it's 315 degree.

	In order to convert the original hex angles into angles you can use in GML,
	use this calculation (rendered here in pseudo-code):

	return (256-hex_angle)*1.40625;

	// theta is the angle of rotation
	// translate point to origin

	// now apply rotation
	float rotatedX = tempX*cos(theta) - tempY*sin(theta);

stackoverflow.com/questions/299267/image-scaling-and-rotating-in-c-c

	The simplest way to scale is:
		dest[dx,dy] = src[ dx*src_width/dest_width , dy*src_height/dest_height ]
	For rotating, the src pixel location can be calculated using a rotation matrix:
		sx,sy = M(dx,dy)

	Mapping for a resize is easy:
		x' = x * ( width' /  width)
		y' = y * (height' / height)
	Mapping for rotation is only a little bit harder.
		x' = x * cos(a) + y * sin(a)
		y' = y * cos(a) - x * sin(a)

stackoverflow.com/questions/20530949/2d-rotation-is-leaving-holes

	The way to avoid having gaps in between valid pixels is to work backwards.
	Rather than taking each pixel in the source image and moving it
	to its place in the destination image by rotating the pixel to a new position,
	you should iterate through each pixel in the destination image
	and figure out which pixel in the source image it corresponds to.

	To do this you just need to go through each pixel (xdraw,ydraw)
	in the destination image and apply the inverse rotation
	to get the corresponding pixel (xorig,yorig) in the source image.

forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/sprites-got-jagged-when-rotating.5258/

	The program is trying to rotate the pixels,
	it doesn't know that the circle is a circle,
	all it knows is to rotate the pixels,
	so it becomes jagged.
	this also happens when rotating most sprites in an image editor,
	not much can be fixed about it.

	You other option is to use effects to blur the edges like anti-aliasing and interpolation
	but those effects will also look bad the more low res they are.

math.stackexchange.com/questions/767945/finding-the-coordinate-of-a-point-using-a-distance-and-an-angle-from-given-point

	With the distance, you have the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
	You could then use your angle to find the angle opposite point B,
	then use sin and cos to get the X and Y distances between A and B.

	Convert x,y to Angle, Distance
		set Angle    to ( (atan of (y/x)) + (180*(x < 0)) ) mod 360
		set Distance to   (sqrt of  x*x)  + (  y*y)

	Normally, you should not sample a texture and render to that same texture at the same time.
	This would give you undefined behavior.
	[...]
	You still don't get to read and write to the same location in a texture at the same time
	unless there is only a single read and write of each texel,
	and the read is in a fragment shader invocation that covers the same sample as the texel it is writing.

		-r : sampling rate (16000 Hz)
		-c : channel (1 for mono, 2 for stereo)

mugenguild.com/forum/topics/grab-problem-184803.0.html

	You'll create a state for the "attempt".
	In this case, state 800.
	If you succeed grabbing the opponent,
	your character will go to state 810,
	and the opponent grabbed will be sent to a custom state
	(custom state means you have to create a state for the opponent to use,
	instead of having the opponent use his own hurt states),
	in your case, opponent will be sent to state 820.

	The same way you have to create a custom state,
	now you need to create a custom animation that the opponent will use.
	That's why the hurt sprites have universal group numbers,
	they are always group 5000, 5001, 5002, 5010, 5011, 5012, etc.,
	and that's why they are required.
	Keep in mind that you will use your own hurt sprites to make the anim 820,
	but the opponent will use their own sprites.
	What you're doing is telling them what sprites they should use in the animation.
	Take KFM's anim 820 as an example,
	it's all KFM's own hurt sprites,
	but when he uses the throw/grab in a different opponent,
	they will use their own sprites while being thrown/grabbed.

	If you use a number that is not present in the opponent sprites,
	say number 7032, for example,
	they will "vanish" because there are no sprites with this number.

mikekohn.net/software/playstation2.php

	In Java Grinder this defaults to

	((RGB_SRC - RGB_FB) * ALPHA_SRC) >> 7 + RGB_FB

	This means if the primitive's alpha channel and texture controls are set to alpha mode,
	the GS will take the RGB value of the texture and subtract it from what's currently drawn on the screen,
	multiplied by the texture's alpha value,
	divided by 128 and added back into the pixel currently in the frame buffer.

	Everything is pixel for pixel and R, G, B.

	Without textures only the alpha bit in the PRIM register should be needed to be set to turn on alpha channels.

	Each pixel can of course have it's own alpha value.

wiki.gbl.gg/w/Vampire_Savior/Hitbox

	Box colors:
		Blue  : Hittable area
		Red   : Attack area
		Green : Push box. Physical collision/existence box

	Note about green boxes:
	Two green boxes can not overlap,
	this prevents characters from walking through one another.

	With the absence of a green box a character can move through another character
	(the characters do not collide, hence "collision box"),
	such as with Lei-Lei or Felicia's forward dashes or when tech rolling from a knockdown.

	When a character has no blue box they are invulnerable (can not be hit),
	though they may (or may not) still posses a green box and be able to push characters or objects around.

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM

	The net byte rate of a Mode-1 CD-ROM, based on comparison to CD-DA audio standards,
	is 44,100 Hz x 16 bits/sample x 2 channels x 2,048 / 2,352 / 8 = 150 KB/s (150 x 2^10) .
	This value, 150 Kbyte/s, is defined as "1x speed".
	Therefore, for Mode 1 CD-ROMs, a 1x CD-ROM drive reads 150/2 = 75 consecutive sectors per second.

	The playing time of a standard CD is 74 minutes, or 4,440 seconds,
	contained in 333,000 blocks or sectors.
	Therefore, the net capacity of a Mode-1 CD-ROM is 650 MB (650 x 2^20).
	For 80 minute CDs, the capacity is 703 MB.

	On a 74-minute CD-R, it is possible to fit larger disc images using raw mode,
	up to 333,000 x 2,352 = 783,216,000 bytes (~747 MB).
	This is the upper limit for raw images created on a 74 min or ~650 MB Red Book CD.
	The 14.8% increase is due to the discarding of error correction data.
